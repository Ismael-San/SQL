# BACI : International Trade Database Analysis

### Table of Contents

### Project Overview
The main objective of this project was to extract insights from international trade products between countries using BACI (Base pour l'Analyse du Commerce International), a bilateral trade flow dataset created by Guillaume Gaulier and Soledad, based on data collected from the United Nations COMTRADE. Several reasons explain the computation of BACI by Gaulier and Soledad:

1. Incomplete Data: COMTRADE has missing values/flows in the country reports sent to the United Nations,       leading to incomplete data.
2. Classification Issues: Some countries use the older SITC classification instead of the current Harmonized   System.
3. Data Discrepancies: There are differences in the data provided by importers and exporters for the same trade flow. One solution to this issue was removing the trade cost value (CIF) from import values.
